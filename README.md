# Deck Share

A new Flutter project to share magic cards between user for tournament.

## Getting Started

This project will make the connection between users that search for a card for a tournament (it's only for share at the beggining).  

The user will create a "wishlist" that he can send to other users and those user can say if thay can share. 
That will create a share between the two user and mark in the wishlist as alreay share for the other users.
