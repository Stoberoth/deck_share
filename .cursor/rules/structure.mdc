The project must follow a feature-first architecture based on Riverpod, organized into 4 layers: presentation, domain, application, and data.
Each feature should have its own folder, containing these 4 subfolders to clearly separate responsibilities.
- The "presentation" folder contains widgets, pages, and UI-related providers.
- The "domain" folder contains business entities, repository interfaces, and pure business logic.
- The "application" folder contains use cases and orchestration logic.
- The "data" folder contains concrete repository implementations, data sources (API, database, etc.), and data models.

Example structure:
features/
  └── feature_name/
        ├── presentation/
        ├── domain/
        ├── application/
        └── data/


Always respect this structure for any new feature or code modification.
